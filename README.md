Pushing the comfort zone

## Description

In this assigement we were to buld a website for a company selling outdoor jackets. The site is buld with mostly HTML and CSS, and then some vanilla Javascript later in the course. The products are fetched with rest API from wordpress, and the contact form is with javascript. This was our first design assigement so the focus on ui/ux design and cms was also important. Wanted to make a easy clean site that would lead the customers to the products that the company wanted to sell without to much distractions.
