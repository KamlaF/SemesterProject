                 major breakthroughs in biology are offering us
                 unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                 <br>
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,<br>
                 thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.<br>
                 Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine<br>
                  and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of<br>
                 penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
                 <br>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,<br>
                 but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                 with the question of our origins.<br>
                 Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution <br>
                 we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.<br>
                  <br>
                 Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. <br>
                 You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,<br>
                  including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                  explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. <br>
                  We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen<br>
                   and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>

                 to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.
